Quantum Approach

To do (Antonio):
- run experiments 4 and 5 agents with QAOA_optimization procedure (comparison with classical BILP)
- save results line by line instead of using pandas 
- check time (the comparisone between quantum annealing and QAOA is not currently right)


TO DO (Supreeth):
- add BOSS implementation in a specific folder (results and time to execution need to be saved in a separate file)
- script to generate fixed distribution (all distributions, from 2 to 11 agents)
